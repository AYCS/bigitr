This tool synchronizes Git and CVS repositories in an asynchronous
fashion.

* It exports branches in Git into branches in CVS.
* It imports branches from CVS into special import branches (with names
  starting with "cvs-" in Git.
* It is the developer's responsibility to merge changes from the
  special cvs-* import branches into appropriate development branches.
  (May later optionally attempt automated merges with additional config.)
* It will not touch the CVS trunk (at least for now).
* Branches in the Git repositories with names starting with "cvs-"
  and "export-" are reserved to be written only by this tool.
  These branches are pushed to the origin repository so that local
  state does not need to be maintained.  This means that multiple
  users can run this tool using the same repository configuration
  but different application configuration (local directories).
  However, no locking is attempted, so if two users run it at the
  same time, the results are undefined.
* This tool commits to CVS and pushes to remove Git repositories.

There are two kinds of configuration files.
* Application configuration: general behavior
* Repository configuration: specific to a Git repository

This tool depends on precise behavior of Git and CVS, and on the "-i"
option to sed.  The behavior of this tool should be validated after
ANY update to any of the programs which it calls: git, cvs, and sed,
as well as after any other update that might affect them (libraries,
system language configuration, etc.).  A test suite is provided to
help validate this behavior.  If you discover failures not exposed by
the test suite, please augment the test suite.  In particular,
additional functional tests or story tests would be appropriate.
This tool automates only (part of) the PROCESS of synchronization
between Git and CVS branches.  It does not automate any MONITORING
of the results.  Do not relax monitoring because you are using it.
For example, if you have changemail notification on CVS, do not disable
it for branches that are developed in Git and pushed to CVS; use that
changemail to confirm that the synchronization process has worked.

This tool also assumes essentially unlimited argument length, as it
passes arbitrarily many file names on the command line.  This limits
it to working on relatively recent Linux kernels (2.6.23 and later)
for large repositories.  At least Python 2.5 is required (due to the
use of "with").
