This tool synchronizes Git and CVS repositories in an asynchronous
fashion.

* It exports branches in Git into branches in CVS.
* It imports brances from CVS into special import branches (with names
  starting with "cvs-" in Git.
* It is the developer's responsibility to merge changes from the
  special cvs-* import branches into appropriate development branches.
* Branches in the Git repositories with names starting with "cvs-"
  and "export-" are reserved to be written only by this tool.

There are two kinds of configuration files.
* Application configuration: general behavior
* Repository configuration: specific to a Git repository

This tool depends on precise behavior of Git and CVS, and on the "-i"
option to sed.  The behavior of this tool should be validated after
ANY update to any of the programs which it calls: git, cvs, and sed,
as well as after any other update that might affect them (libraries,
system language configuration, etc.).  A test suite is provided to
help validate this behavior.  If you discover failures not exposed by
the test suite, please augment the test suite.  In particular,
additional functional tests or story tests would be appropriate.
